Department of Language Information Management at the State Ministry of Education and Communication University of China (CUC), was established on September 16th, 2005. Relying on the subject characteristics and comprehensive advantages of mass media in China, the Center is based on theoretical research, and sets applied research as the emphasis and service the country as the goal, to carry out organized and open scientific research. The distinctive features of the Center lie in many aspects like accumulation of media language resources, development of language tools, application of language data, construction of language engineering, as well as in language monitoring achievements&#39; services to the country and society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Center tries to explore language monitoring theories, and firstly puts forward language monitoring framework system and Temporal-Spatial Modeling of Vocabulary in Chinese. It has constructed Media Language Corpus (MLC), a dynamic circulating broadcast media language corpus with large scale and multi-mode, and Chinese Mandarin Digital Multi-modal Corpus (CMDMC). The Center has developed language information processing platform for language monitoring, including the automatic segmentation and tagging system CUCBst (including its stand-alone and online-free versions), speech and video retrieval system, automatic monitoring system of alphabetic words in Chinese, extraction system of new words and expressions, extraction system of popular words and phrases, the Chinese character/word frequency statistics tool RCRS &amp; TCRS, etc. The Center has established a website which is based on China and faces the world - the Platform for Media Language Resources Service (http://ling.cuc.edu.cn), a sharing platform of media language resources, a service platform for Applied Linguistics research, and a communication platform for mandarin Chinese monitoring technologies. The Center has also built the National Public Opinion Database of Language, which has achievement the automatic monitoring of public opinions on Chinese language, and the monitoring achievements are submitted to Department of Language Information Management at the State Ministry of Education and its other centers for language resources monitoring and research, to be the data source of the internal reference Yuqing Xinxi (the Information about Public Opinions of Language).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the establishment, the Center has devoted to the investigation and research on broadcast media language, participated in the issue of the Year Book on Language Situation in China (i.e. Lvpishu) and the release of the Top 10s of Popular Words and Phrases in Media, taken on the research and release of the Top 10s of New Words and Expressions in Media, and edited and published the annual dictionary of Chinese New Words and Expressions (2007-2018).
